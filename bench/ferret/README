To setup this benchmark, you will need to unpack the data necessary to run
ferret and compile the source.

The source comes with 5 versions: 
serial: pure serial code
tbb: an implementation using TBB pipeline constructs as documented in [1] 
parsec3-tbb: a similar TBB implementation that came with Parsec 3.0 release  
pthreads: a pthreaded implementation that came with Parsec 3.0 release
cilk: a hand compiled Cilk implementation running on Cilk-M 0.9
 
To make each version, go into the src/ directory and type 'make'.
Alternatively, type 'make $version' for each of the version listed above.

To run the benchmark, you will first need to setup the image database:
cd into the input/ directory and do ./unpack.sh

Finally, to run, execute the various run scripts in the top directory.
